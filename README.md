Python Network Sniffer
Introduction

The Python Network Sniffer is a tool developed to monitor and analyze network traffic in real-time. It captures packets transmitted over a network interface, providing insights into the data flow, protocols used, and potential security threats. This project was developed as part of my cybersecurity internship to understand practical networking, packet analysis, and Python programming for security applications.

Objective

To capture and analyze network packets for educational and security purposes.

To understand how data flows across a network and how different protocols work.

To develop skills in Python programming, networking, and cybersecurity.

To identify potential vulnerabilities or unusual activity in network traffic.

Key Concepts

Packet Sniffing: Capturing network packets passing through a network interface.

Protocols: Understanding network protocols like TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

Packet Analysis: Examining packet headers and payloads to extract useful information.

Filtering: Using filters to capture only relevant packets based on protocol, IP, or port.

Security Awareness: Recognizing abnormal traffic patterns or potential attacks.

Features

Real-time packet capture from network interfaces.

Detailed analysis of packet headers including source/destination IP and ports.

Filtering packets by protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP).

Logs and displays captured packets in an organized format.

Educational tool for learning networking and cybersecurity concepts.

Tools and Technologies

Python: Main programming language.

Scapy: Library for network packet manipulation and analysis.

Socket Programming: For capturing raw packets from network interfaces.

Operating System: Linux/Kali Linux preferred for raw packet capturing.

How It Works

The sniffer listens on a specified network interface.

Captured packets are decoded to extract header information (IP addresses, protocol, ports).

Packets are displayed in real-time on the console.

Optional filters can be applied to capture only specific types of traffic.

Logs can be stored for further analysis.

Applications

Learning network protocols and data flow.

Monitoring network traffic for security testing.

Detecting abnormal or suspicious network activity.

Practical experience in Python programming for cybersecurity.
